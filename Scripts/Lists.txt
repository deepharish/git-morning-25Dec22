6) RRCleanup - How to use RRCleanup.exe Utility to Delete Repository and cleanup Orphan records IP17 (Doc ID  2257977.1)

Throughly after Repository Deletion with Orpan Records? (Doc ID 27078311.1)

It is Recommended to PErform this Sequence: First delete RR, then delete B, then perform Orphan records without passing any repository.
This will clean the repository and any orphan records left over.

Step 1:
List the repositories present in repective environment and export those name with below query
	
	select created, Row_ID, NAME from S_REPOSITORY order by CREATED Description

Step 2:
	Take the count from LOV tables and make a note of count Value.
		
			Select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL;
			O/P -->1651308

Step 3:
	Take the count of LOV's not in Workspace ID. Mostly the count value would be Zero only.
	
		Select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL where WS_ID NOT IN (Select w.row_id from siebel.S_WORKSPACE W);

Step 4:
	The floowing command to delete a particular repository data from repository tables:
	
	Syntax: 
	RRCleanup.exe -t "Table Owner" -u "Siebel User Name" -p "Siebel User Name Password" -r "Repository Name" -o "ODBC Data Source" -s "Path that contains odbcsql command" -b Repository Type 
	
	Note: For the -r argument, you can pass only one repository at a time as a parameter. For the -b argument, you can pass either of the repository types as parameter such as -b R to delete data from runtime repository tables or â€“b B to delete data from all repository tables
	
	Example:
	RRCleanup.exe -t SIEBEL -u siebel -p <Siebel Password> -r "Repository Name_OLD" -o "ODBC Name" -s E:\siebel\tools -b "B"
	
Step 5:
	Use the following command to delete orphan records. If you choose "-a", it applies to ALL orphan data. It essentially goes over all worspace-enabled tables(DR,RR, and LOV) and does "DELETE from XXX where WS_ID NOT in (select Row_ID from S_WORKSPACE).
	
	Syntax: 
	RRCleanup.exe -t "Table Owner" -u "Siebel User Name" -p "Siebel User Name Password" -a Y -o "ODBC Data Source" -s "Path that contains odbcsql command" -b Repository Type 

	Example:
	RRCleanup.exe -t "SIEBEL" -u "SIEBEL" -p "Siebel Password" -a Y -o "ODBC Data Source" -s d:\siebel\Tools\bin -b "B"
	
Step 6:
	To Check any LOV's present which are not present the workspace.
	
	Select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL where WS_ID NOT IN (Select w.row_id from siebel.S_WORKSPACE w);
	
	select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL;
	
	If count match with above query, do NOT processed with below steps.

Step 7:

	Delete from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL where WS_ID NOT IN(select w.row_id from siebel.S_WORKSPACE w);

Step 8:
Verify the result(record count) with step 3
	Select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL where WS_ID NOT IN (Select w.row_id from siebel.S_WORKSPACE w);
	
	select count(1) from siebel.S_LST_OF_VAL;

6) git cheat sheet of GIT hub commands -- 
	After creating the repository in github.com
 I) Follow the below steps in client on your OS system
		git init		--> It initilize the empty repository with .git directory
		vi python_code.py
		git add python_code.py(Single file) or git add . (all files) 
		git status 
			- From Working tree it add in Index/staging Area
		git commit -s "First commit"  - Show an error unauthorise user
			- the file move from Index/staging to Local Branch
		git config --global user.email "harish@gmail.com"
		git config --global user.name "harish"  - user name of Github
		git commit -s "First commit"  
			- the file move from Index/staging to Local Branch
			- Commited successfully to Local Branch 
		before moving to git push, the default branch is Master 
		git branch
		They changed to MAIN
		git branch -M "main"  - as a default branch.
		git branch
		git remote add origin "https://github.com/deepharish/git-morning-25Dec22.git"
		git remove -v 
		Before pushing to github server repository provide the credentials
		go to github.com/settings/tokens from developer setting - Personal access tokens  and provide all the access then  and click on Generate Token button and copy the password. 
		
		git push -u orgin 'main'
			user name - harish
			password - enter the Generate token password.
		Finally the file pushed from local branch to Remote server branch MAIN(github). 
		
		git log --oneline - to see the status of commit and log.
		
		IF any modified done on Github or X person then to compare 
		git fetch  - to show the latest version object between source and TargetRepositoryName
		git pull - to pull from Github to local GIT branch.
	
Merge/conflicit-->
		git pull 		-- updated all files from remote to local (git)
		git fetch		-- to show latest version from local and remote
		and changed file1.txt 
		git log --oneline
	add and commit can do one command 
		git commit -a -m "two in one like -a add and commit"
		git push origin main
				show an error like conflict and it failed to merge in remote 
		git pull
				- merge conflict failed and do the git add and rebase 
			connect with 2 developer and resolve the conflict on file1.txt then push .
		git add file1.txt
		git commit --amend (do the change like resolve conflict commit) then git rebase --continue
		git push origin main
	
GIT Branching strategy -->				
		To create a new branch
		git branch fb1
		git checkout fb1
		git commit -a -m "Pushing to FB1 branch in Remote"
		git push origin fb1
		then merge the fb1 version control files to main through Github URL
		once merge is done. delete the branch fb1 in local with below commands
		git branch -D fb1
.gitignore -->
			will create a file call .gitignore to ignore the files that present in the file
			vi .gitignore
				file1.txt
				readme.md
			:wq!
			
			git status
			git commit -a -m "added the .gitignore"

8) Difference between Snapshot and AMI - Image snapshot (RJR Herbal Hospital) 

Only data taking called Snapshot- Cannot create a new instance only backup of data
Software & Application + Data called AMI(Bootable) - To create a new Instance

AMI=AMI+Snapshot
